What are we doing here???
======
I've worked in Cyber Security for around 10 years now, wild to think about. I love it, really, like all aspects of it. Over my time in the industry, I have found interest in so many different areas ... Incident Response, Malware Analysis, Pen Testing, Red Teaming, Adversary Emulation, all things threat - hunting, intelligence, detection, mapping, tracking, slighly unrelated, but very much an item of interest, Data Science. 

To further add to the chaos, every single one of those areas have sub-areas, if you really want to call yourself an expext in let's say Incident Response, you need to know host-based evidence, network-based evidence, meaningful forensics (disk and memory), and that's just supericially scatching the surface. 

Over the years, I've been like a little kid playing outfielder on a TBall field "Oh look, a butterfly!" and off I go to another topic. While this has allowed me to be keep up at a conversationally level, if i'm being honest with myself, it's never much more than that. If I'm being REALLY honest, it probably has something with me trying to foolishly be a "know it all". Can't do it, not effective, 10/10 don't recommend. *I've learned it's way more important and usefull to get it right, rather than be right.* SHOUT OUT to Brene Brown.

I've come to the realization that I need to reign in my broad generalization for a more focused specialization, that allows me to grow, develop, and ultimately by more effective. While priorities will never be static, I'm going to start this renewed focus by answering an important question:

***Professionally, who am I and who do I want to be???**

I'm a passionate Security Engineer who uses threat intelligence and data analysis techniques. I want to be able to take data, use technically sound techniques and make informed decisions that aid in the ability detect, disrupt, and deny bad guys from doing bad things.

With just that in mind, my development focus will be on consuming and processing threat intelligence, data analysis techniques focused on anomaly detection, and how to scale, grow, and teach these topics to interested parties.

Ultimately this is an effort to hold myself accountable and focus on a few things that are important to me, share and document my learnings. If I can do that I'll be happy.
