Daily learning/experience notes for tracking and comprehension checks.

AM Session
======

The Finding Ghosts in your Data book took an unexpected turn and todays topic focused on code testing. I didn't think a book focused on data anomalies would dedicate a sectin to testing, but I'm glad. Formal, structured code testing is an unfamiliar area for me, I typically, admittedly to a fault, just shift+enter to execute code blocks in a Jupyter Notebook cell until it works as expected. This is what "fail fast" means right? Not quite, I knew I was doing it wrong, but was focused on doing it fast rather than right and in the end my projects work, but probably not as well as they could've and they probably didn't or don't integrate well with others, but I'm learning or trying at least.

The book covered unit and integration testing. Unit tests a focused on testing the specific actions of a function or method - making sure it works as expected with with various inputs good, bad, extreme edge cases etc. Where integration testings covers how different code pieces work together, the simple example explained in the book discusses how the comonents of the API call the backend processing functions.


We'll be using pytest to implement the testing, another library I've never worked with before so keeping an open mind about that.


Looking ahead
======

Tomorrow we continue. Looking forward to building test cases that support the mission here. Also getting through the cruft and spending time with the functional components of anomaly detection.
