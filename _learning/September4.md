Daily learning/experience notes for tracking and comprehension checks.

AM Session
======

Had some hiccups today getting started, but finally made some progress. Continuing work on "Finding ghosts in your data" book. Decided to just fork the repo and work from my dev/personal machine and then clone the forked repo on my server dedicated to running my apps.

Following along with the book instructions I set up the initial framing structure of the API for processing data requests. The book uses uvicorn, which I was previously had never worked with before, but interestingly enough some coworkers recently shared an app they made that uses uvicorn that I thought was pretty slick, so I guess - he universe provides.

I built a couple of API endpoints one basic root stub and another to handle POST requests for some follow-on anomaly detection projects around univariate data types.

Looking ahead
======

Tomorrow we continue.
